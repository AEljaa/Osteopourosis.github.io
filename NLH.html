						<h1>No Longer Human - Osamu Dazai </h1>
						<p>Brief Review: A very good read, actually this book got me back into reading for the moment. A very dark and tragic story, highlighting the difficulty of addiction and how poor mental health and addiction is a tale of disaster. Some parts were hard to follow and understand who exactly was doing what and also it would have been nice if we could have been told what age oba was during these moments of his life more frequently, however, that is a minor complaint. A very good book.</p>
